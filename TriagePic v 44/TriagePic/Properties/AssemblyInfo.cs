// Asterisk sign instructs Visual Studio to assign on each build a version 1.0.d.s,
// where d is the number of days since February 1, 2000, and s is the number of seconds since midnight/2.
// This will generate a warning at compile time, but that's good, reminds you to bump the version number.
// Code within TriagePic translates d and s into a date and time, displayed in the title bar.
