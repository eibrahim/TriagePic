[The following is an example statement for attachment to an anonymized, de-identified record generated by "TriagePic".  Full records (e.g., patient-identified) may have different statements.]

Notice of Privacy Practices and Information Distribution
========================================================
The attached record was generated by a "TriagePic" application, operated by Suburban Hospital personnel at the point where disaster victims arrive at the hospital.  While the application does generate real-time patient-specific information (text and photo), the attached record has been anonymized/de-identified to remove patient identifiers (e.g., no photo), and is intended for public release.  It retains categorial information on gender and adult-vs.-child ("Peds"), as well as arrival time, and the hospital personnel involved.  It is intended to be useful for disaster situational awareness and rate-of-arrival purposes.

No system of de-identification that retains any useful information is perfect.  The recipient who uses this record in an effort to re-identify patients is responsible for any legal ramifications and potential violations of HIPAA or other laws pertaining to patient confidentiality.
