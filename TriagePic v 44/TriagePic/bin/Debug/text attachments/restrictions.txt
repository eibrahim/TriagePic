[This document is a straw man example, based on a reworking of the HIPAA policy statement at www.hhs.gov/hipaafaq/providers/hipaa-1068.html.  It has not been reviewed by legal council, nor reviewed or approved by Suburban Hospital or any other BHEPP member.]

[The following is an example statement for attachment to a full record generated by "TriagePic".  Partial records (e.g., de-identified) have different statements.]

Notice of Privacy Practices and Information Distribution
========================================================
Suburban Hospital is covered by HIPAA, so the provided disaster victim information (the "record", which may include a photo) is governed by provisions of the HIPAA Privacy Rule.

During a disaster, HIPPA permits disclosures for treatment purposes, and certain disclosures to disaster relief organizations (like the American Red Cross) so that family members can be notified of the patient's location.  (See CFR 164.510(b)(4).

The primary of purpose of the record is for family reunification.  Secondary usages may include in-hospital patient tracking, treatment/continuity-of-care on patient transfer, disaster situational awareness and resource management, and feedback to emergency medical service providers who provide pre-hospital treatment.  The record (in various forms) will be distributed within Suburban Hospital, and to and within the institutions with which Suburban Hospital partners through the Bethesda Hospital Emergency Preparedness Partnership.  These are the NIH Clinical Center, National Naval Medical Hospital, and National Library of Medicine.  In particular, the record is sent to NLM's Lost Person Finder database for exposure through the web site, with appropriate filtering and verification.  HIPAA allows patients to be listed in the facility directory, and some aspects of Lost Person Finder are analogous to that.  For more, see the Notice of Privacy Practices associated with the LPF web site.  

The record was generated by a "TriagePic" application, operated by Suburban Hospital personnel.  The application includes the ability to express the following [TO DO]:

- patient agrees to let hospital personnel speak with family members or friends involved in the patient's care (45 CFR 164.510(b));
- patient wishes to opt out of the facility directory (45 CFR 164.510(a));  [THIS MIGHT BE INTERPRETED AS OPTING OUT OF LPF.  MORE TO UNDERSTAND.]
- patient requests privacy restrictions (45 CFR 164.522(a))
- patient requests confidential communications (45 CFR 164.522(b))

[IMPLICATIONS OF THESE CHOICES ON RECORD GENERATION NOT YET KNOWN.]

In addition, there is a requirement to distribute a notice of privacy practices, addressed by this attachment and the LPF Notice of Privacy Practices.

Penalties for non-compliance with the above five rules may be waived, for a limited time in a limited geographical area, if the President declares an emergency or disaster AND the Health and Human Services Secretary declares a public health emergency.  Within that declared timespan, a hospital may rely on the waiver (which covers all patients present) only from the moment of instituting its disaster protocol to at most 72 hours later.  For more, see www.hhs.gov/hipaafaq/providers/hipaa-1068.html.  The waiver is authorized under the Project Bioshield Act of 2004 (PL 108-276) and section 1135(b) of the Social Security Act.
